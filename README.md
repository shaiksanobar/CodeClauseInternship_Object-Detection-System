🧠 Object Detection System

I’m Sanobar, currently doing my internship at Code Clause, and this is one of the projects assigned to me during my internship.

⸻

🎯 Aim

Develop a system that can detect and classify objects in images or video streams.

⸻

📄 Description

This project focuses on building an object detection model capable of identifying and locating multiple objects within an image or video.
The model uses a pre-trained architecture such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Faster R-CNN, and is customized to detect specific objects of interest.

🧰 Technologies Used
	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Frameworks: TensorFlow / PyTorch
	•	Library: OpenCV
	•	Tools: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

⚙️ Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your systembr:<br>
	1.	Clone the Repository:
    git clone https://github.com/shaiksanobar/object-detection-system.git
    cd object-detection-<br>
    2.Install Required pip install -r requirements.txt<br>
3.	Download Pre-trained Model Weights<br>
	•	You can use YOLOv5 or Faster R-CNN pre-trained weights.
	•	Place the downloaded weights in the models/ directory.<br>
4.	Run the Script<br>
python detect.py<br>
5.	Upload an Image or Video<br>
	•	The program will detect and classify objects in real time or from uploaded files.<br>
